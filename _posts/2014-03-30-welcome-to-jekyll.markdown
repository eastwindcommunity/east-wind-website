You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post.

Type 

    jekyll build #I do not know if this is the right command, but it seems to work. 

This turns the markdown post into a static website. 

Type 

    jekyll serve 

This starts your local server. You can go to your browser and type 

    localhost:4000

This will take you to your main page.  It will show you the list of posts, and you can click on this post to see your changes.

re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
