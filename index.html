<h2>Welcome to East Wind</h2>

<p>East Wind is a community of people living and working in the beautiful hills of the Missouri Ozarks. We hold our land, labor, and other resources in common. We are a member of the Federation of Egalitarian Communities, and as such, we put great value in cooperation, nonviolence, and sharing. Our aim is to create an egalitarian communal lifestyle. We encourage individuality and diversity in our members.</p>

<p>We support ourselves through two industries: East Wind Nut Butters and Utopian Rope Sandals. You can purchase our products at East Wind Crafts. Our work lives are busy and varied, but we always find time to relax and enjoy community meals, music jams, and Ozark sunsets. Our land is one of a kind, very rural, and filled with all sorts of wildlife.
Prospective members and other visitors are asked to contact us first at ew.membership@gmail.com, as dropping in unannounced is not accepted.</p>
